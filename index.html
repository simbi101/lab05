            <p> The lecture covered CSS this time, focusing on the differences between internal and external styles. I
                found this task difficult, but I was really thankful for a classmate to guide me through the assignment,
                and also to learn how to do the stylesheet with some guidance with classmates.
            </p>
            <p>Went through the W3Schools site which really helped me go through each step for the style CSS.
                It was very helpful, and my classmate gave me guidance with colors and putting the things in order,
                including background color, etc., so I had to keep that in mind for styling the website.
                Another important thing I learned was the syntax for the color and inserting rules making sure for
                example enter body enter color blue, this will be on the site. When adding the lab02 file to lab03 and
                style.css, I was confused and stuck there for a day and frustrated.
                Thanks to a classmate who was kind and saw me in need of guidance and helped me find a cite source given
                in the Brightspace. I could copy the format and input my ideas for the style.css and finally saw the
                colors attached to the site.
